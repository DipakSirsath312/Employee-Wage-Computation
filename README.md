# 🧮 Employee Wage Computation (Java Project)
This is a Java-based Employee Wage Computation System that calculates and manages the daily and
monthly wages of employees for one or more companies based on their working hours, attendance, and pay rate.

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects,
encapsulation, and methods — making it an ideal learning project for beginners in Java.
